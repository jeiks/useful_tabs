# Just saving useFUL(less) browser tabs to free up memory
## and clearing my desktop (it's better for my eyes.. lol)

I got myself with many browser windows open on my desktop. But many links already open will not be used again or will open in a new browser window.

But we can't close them, right? We always feel we are losing something important.

So I created this code (as simpler as possible) just to save lists of URLs in text files (json format). You can also open and edit these files when you want to visit/see some older link.
