# Just saving useFUL(less) browser tabs to free up memory
## and clearing my desktop (it's better for my eyes.. lol)

I got myself with many browser windows open on my desktop. But many links will not be used again or I will find and open it again in a new browser window.

But you know... we can't close them, right? We always feel we are losing something important.

So I created this code (as simpler as possible) just to save lists of URLs in text files (json format). You can also open and edit these files when you want to visit/see them.
